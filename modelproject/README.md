# Model analysis project

Our model project is based on the Malthusian model. The model describes economies that have not undergone the demographic transition. In this context, if technological progress results in increased income per person, fertility rates also rise. This leads to population growth, where a larger population competes for the same land resources, resulting in diminishing returns to scale and, consequently, a decline in income per capita.

In this project we consider a Malthus model where we apply fertility as the main factor of the model. We begin by analyzing the model using Sympy, after which we also demonstrate a numerical solution to the problem. Later in the project we introduce a permanent technological shocks to analyze how it affects the model. Additionally, we also add a positive trend in technology. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
