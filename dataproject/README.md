# Data analysis project

Our data project is titled Inflation, Unemployment, and Gender in various work fields. 
The goal of this project is to analyze the employment rates of men and women across various industries. We intend to present both the overall employment figures and highlight differences within specific sectors. Our objective is to identify sectors where one gender is predominant over the other and vice versa. Additionally, we aim to examine employment growth rates over time and assess how external factors, such as the 2020 pandemic, have impacted workforce dynamics. Through this analysis, we seek to gain insights into gender representation in the labor market and understand the effects of external events on employment trends.
The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. AULP01.csv 
2. PRIS111.csv 
3. KAS301.csv

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``dstApi``
